# perlORF
Counting open reading frames using perl
This program counts open reading frames from NCBI Nucleotides. 
To run, perl a03.pl and feed hs_.fa

Please note that this was for a class, and subroutines_for_a3.pm were given. 
Although time complexity can be improved, a constraint was working around the given submodule,
which already contained a for loop.
